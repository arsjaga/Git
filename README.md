# Getting Started 

## Installing Git

#### Installing on Linux

* If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. 

* If youâ€™re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try apt:

  `$ sudo apt install git-all`

  `$ git --version`
